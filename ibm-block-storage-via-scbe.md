## IBM Block Storage System via IBM Spectrum Control Base Edition

IBM block storage can be used as persistent storage for Kubernetes and Docker containers via Ubiquity service.
Ubiquity communicates with the IBM storage systems through [IBM Spectrum Control Base Edition](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/STWMS9) (SCBE) 3.2.0. SCBE creates a storage profile (for example, gold, silver or bronze) and makes it available for Docker or Kubernetes plugins.

The following IBM block storage systems are available:
- IBM Spectrum Accelerate Family products:
   - IBM FlashSystem A9000 and A9000R
   - IBM XIV
- IBM Spectrum Virtualize Family products:
   - IBM FlashSystem V9000
   - IBM SAN Volume Controller 
   - IBM Storwize Family
   


## Installing and configuring SCBE

   * See [IBM Knowledge Center](http://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/STWMS9/landing/IBM_Spectrum_Control_Base_Edition_welcome_page.html) 
 for instructions on how download, install and configure SCBE software.
   * After IBM SCBE is installed, do the following :

       1. Log into Spectrum Control Base Edition server at https://SCBE_IP_address:8440.
       2. Add a Ubiquity interface. Note: The Ubiqity interface username and the password will be used in the ubiquity server configuration file below. In this SCBE version, Ubiquity interface is referred to as “Containers interface” (this will be modified in future version).
       3. Add the IBM storage systems to be used with the Ubiquity plugin.
       4. Create storage service(s) with required storage capacities and capabilities. This service(s) will be available for provisioning (as a profile option) from the plugin side ([Docker](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-docker-plugin), [Kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-k8s))
       5. Delegate at least one storage service to the Ubiquity interface.

## Configuring Ubiquity service for SCBE

* The `ubiquity-server.conf` must be created in the `/etc/ubiquity` directory. Configure the service by editing the file, as illustrated below.


```toml
port = 9999                     # The TCP port to listen on.
logPath = "/var/tmp"            # The Ubiquity will write logs to the "ubiquity.log" file in this location. 
defaultBackend = "scbe"         # Possible options are spectrum-scale, spectrum-scale-nfs or scbe.
configPath = "/opt/ubiquityDB"  # Path to directory where Ubiquity can create it's sqlite DB.

[ScbeConfig]
DefaultService = "gold"         # SCBE storage service to be used by default, if not specified by the plugin.
DefaultVolumeSize = "5"         # Optional parameter. Default is 1.
DefaultFilesystemType = "ext4"  # Optional parameter. Default is ext4. Possible values are ext4 or xfs.
UbiquityInstanceName = "instance1" # A prefix for any new volume created on the storage system. Default is none.

[ScbeConfig.ConnectionInfo]
managementIp = "IP Address"     # SCBE server IP or FQDN.
Port = 8440                     # SCBE server port. Optional parameter. Default is 8440.

[ScbeConfig.ConnectionInfo.CredentialInfo]
Username = "user"               # User name defined for SCBE Ubiquity interface.
Password = "password"           # Password defined for SCBE Ubiquity interface.
```

  * Verify that the logPath, exists on the host before you start the Ubiquity service.
  * Verify that the configPath, exists on the host before you start the Ubiquity service.

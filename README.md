The Ubiquity project enables persistent storage for the Kubernetes and Docker container frameworks. It is a pluggable framework available for different storage systems. The framework interfaces with the storage systems, using their plugins. Different container frameworks can use Ubiquity concurrently, allowing access to different storage systems.

Ubiquity supports the Kubernetes and Docker frameworks, using the following plugins:

- [Ubiquity plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-k8s) (Dynamic Provisioner and FlexVolume)
- [Ubiquity Docker volume plugin](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-docker-plugin), for testing only.

The IBM official solution for Kubernetes, based on the Ubiquity project, is referred to as IBM Storage Enabler for Containers. You can download the installation package and its documentation from [IBM Fix Central](http://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/quickorder?parent=Software%20defined%20storage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Storage+Enabler+for+Containers&release=All&platform=All&function=all&source=fc).

Ubiquity supports the following storage systems:
* IBM block storage.

    IBM block storage is supported for Kubernetes via IBM Spectrum Connect. Ubiquity communicates with the IBM storage systems through Spectrum Connect. Spectrum Connect creates a storage profile (for example, gold, silver or bronze) and makes it available for Kubernetes.
   
* IBM Spectrum Scale

   IBM Spectrum Scale file storage is supported for Kubernetes. Ubiquity communicates with IBM Spectrum Scale system directly via IBM Spectrum Scale management API v2.

The code is provided as is, without warranty. Any issue will be handled on a best-effort basis.

## Solution overview

![Ubiquity Overview](images/ubiquity_architecture_draft_for_github.jpg)

Description of Ubiquity Kubernetes deployment:
   *   Ubiquity Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioner (ubiquity-k8s-provisioner) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.
   *   Ubiquity Kubernetes FlexVolume (ubiquity-k8s-flex) runs as a Kubernetes daemonset in all the worker and master nodes.
   *   Ubiquity (ubiquity) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.
   *   Ubiquity database (ubiquity-db) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.

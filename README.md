The Ubiquity project enables persistent storage for the Kubernetes and Docker container frameworks. It is a pluggable framework available for different storage systems. The framework interfaces with the storage systems, using their plugins. Different container frameworks can use Ubiquity concurrently, allowing access to different storage systems.
Ubiquity supports the Kubernetes and Docker frameworks, using the following plugins:

Ubiquity supports the Kubernetes and Docker frameworks, using the following plugins:

- [Ubiquity plugin for Kubernetes](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-k8s) (Dynamic Provisioner and FlexVolume)
- [Ubiquity Docker volume plugin](https://github.com/IBM/ubiquity-docker-plugin), for testing only.

Currently, the following storage systems use Ubiquity:
* IBM block storage.

   The IBM block storage is supported for Kubernetes via IBM Spectrum Control Base Edition (SCBE) version 3.3.0 and later. Ubiquity communicates with the IBM storage systems through SCBE. SCBE creates a storage profile (for example, gold, silver or bronze) and makes it available for Kubernetes. For details about supported storage systems, refer to the latest SCBE release notes.
   
   The IBM official solution for Kubernetes, based on the Ubiquity project, is referred to as IBM Storage Enabler for Containers. You can download the installation package and its documentation from [IBM Fix Central](https://www-945.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/swg/selectFixes?parent=Software%2Bdefined%2Bstorage&product=ibm/StorageSoftware/IBM+Spectrum+Control&release=All&platform=Linux&function=all). For details on the IBM Storage Enabler for Containers, see the relevant sections in the SCBE user guide.   

* IBM Spectrum Scale, for testing only.

The code is provided as is, without warranty. Any issue will be handled on a best-effort basis.

Description of Ubiquity Kubernetes deployment:
   *   Ubiquity Kubernetes Dynamic Provisioner (ubiquity-k8s-provisioner) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.
   *   Ubiquity Kubernetes FlexVolume (ubiquity-k8s-flex) runs as a Kubernetes daemonset on all the worker and master nodes.
   *   Ubiquity (ubiquity) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.
   *   Ubiquity database (ubiquity-db) runs as a Kubernetes deployment with replica=1.
